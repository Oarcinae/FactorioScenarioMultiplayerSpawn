# OARC Multiplayer Spawn
A Factorio mod for allowing separate spawn locations in multiplayer. Designed for Co-op and PvE. 

[MOD Portal Link](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/oarc-mod)

## WORK IN PROGRESS
The mod should mostly be stable now for use in Factorio V2.0 now.
Space Age support is still in progress but the Nauvis part works fine. I'm still working on support for separate landing sites on other planets.

## Read the WIKI
The github wiki page will have the most up to date information. If you have questions, go there first, otherwise just ask.

## Versions
###### Mod Only Versions: 
Check releases for stable versions. Or just go to the actual mod page like a normal person: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/oarc-mod  
2.1.X supports Factorio V2.0 with and without the Space Age expansion.  
2.0.X supports Factorio V1.1.110 and has a nicer GUI but fewer features than the older scenario version.

###### Scenario Versions: 
1.1.X is the latest stable version for Factorio V1 that I plan to do minimal maintenance on.  
0.17 and 0.16 have final stable versions that will no longer be maintained.  

## Status
Latest 2.1.X version is mostly stable and playable on Factorio V2.0.X  
Currently working on adding support for the new Space Age planets.  
Will be removing many of the soft-mod features and other feature creep things for the first version.
