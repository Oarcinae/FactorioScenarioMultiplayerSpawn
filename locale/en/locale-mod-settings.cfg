[mod-description]
oarc-mod=This is a multiplayer mod that allows every player to create their own spawn point when they join the game. There are a lot of helpful features to ensure that new players can join at anytime in the game or even join other player's spawn areas.\n\n[color=red][font=default-bold]Please check out the github page and discord for more information and support.[/font][/color]\n\n[font=default-small]This USED to be available as a scenario, but now is only provided as a mod. To start a new game with this mod, just use the default freeplay scenario. The scenario included in this mod only provides a template to overwrite the default freeplay scenario. It also provides a way for experienced server hosts to configure settings from a file instead of through the usual mod settings. Please read the control.lua file inside the scenario for notes.[/font]

[mod-setting-description]
oarc-mod-default-allow-spawning-on-other-surfaces=This controls the default starting setting for whether to allow spawning on other surfaces. If enabled, by default all other surfaces will be available for players to spawn on. [color=red]If you have other mods installed that add additional surfaces, I recommend leaving this disabled. Regardless of this setting, you can configure which surfaces allow spawning using the in game settings menu.[/color]
oarc-mod-linked-chest-size=This is the size of the shared chest that players can use to share items with other players. This is only meaningful if the shared chest feature is enabled.

Otherwise it will default to main team allowed only.[/font][/color]
oarc-mod-enable-separate-teams=Allow players to start their own teams (CO-OP only, No PVP). This lets players have their own research progress.\n[color=red][font=default-bold]You must enable one or both of the main team and separate team options. Otherwise it will default to main team allowed only.[/font][/color]

oarc-mod-allow-moats-around-spawns=Allow players to choose spawns with a moat around them.
oarc-mod-enable-moat-bridging=If the spawn area is surrounded by land, the moat will have a small land bridge connecting it.
oarc-mod-minimum-distance-to-existing-chunks=This is the minimum distance a new spawn will be created from existing chunks (even if not visible).
oarc-mod-near-spawn-distance=The minimum distance a player can choose to spawn from the origin. This is used as a starting point for the search algorithm so is not a guaranteed distance.
oarc-mod-far-spawn-distance=The maximum distance a player can choose to spawn from the origin. This is used as a starting point for the search algorithm so is not a guaranteed distance.

oarc-mod-enable-buddy-spawn=Allow spawning with a buddy. 2 players can spawn next to each other with their own starting areas.
oarc-mod-enable-offline-protection=This inhibits enemy attacks on bases where all players are offline. Not 100% guaranteed!
oarc-mod-enable-shared-team-vision=Makes sure all teams can see each other's map and radar coverage.
oarc-mod-enable-shared-team-chat=All teams can see each other's chat messages.
oarc-mod-enable-shared-spawns=Allow players to share their spawn areas for other players to join.
oarc-mod-number-of-players-per-shared-spawn=Number of players that can join a shared spawn, including the original player.
oarc-mod-enable-friendly-fire=Enables friendly fire. So you can shoot your chests (or run over your friends with a train). This lets you damage your OWN team.

oarc-mod-main-force-name=The name of the main force. This is the default team that is created when the game starts.
oarc-mod-default-surface=The default surface that players will spawn on if they join the main team or if spawning on other surfaces is not enabled.
oarc-mod-enable-secondary-spawns=Enabling this will provide players with a secondary spawn point when they first move to a new surface/planet. This is only applicable if the other surface is enabled for separate spawns.

oarc-mod-scale-resources-around-spawns=This scales resources around every spawn area so far away spawns aren't immediately next to very rich deposits.
oarc-mod-modified-enemy-spawning=This scales the enemy spawning globally based on the allowed spawn distances to avoid every spawn being surrounded by behemoth worms.
oarc-mod-modified-enemy-easy-evo=This is the maximum evolution that the enemies in the warning zone (closest) to a spawn will be FIXED at to ensure all players have a safe start! The warning zone area can be configured via the custom scenario.
oarc-mod-modified-enemy-medium-evo=This is the maximum evolution that the enemies in the danger zone (next closest) to a spawn will be allowed to reach. Helps ensure players have a safe start! The danger zone area can be configured via the custom scenario.
oarc-mod-minimum-online-time=The minimum time a player must be online before they leave, otherwise their spawn area will be cleaned up.
oarc-mod-respawn-cooldown-min=The minimum time a player must wait before they can change their spawn point to a new location.
oarc-mod-enable-shared-power=This allows players to share their power network with other players. It will create a special power pole at their spawn point that connects to the shared power network wirelessly.
oarc-mod-enable-shared-chest=This gives players a special chest they can use to share items with other players. It uses the "linked-chest" item that is a hidden feature in factorio.

oarc-mod-enable-regrowth=Enables regrowth. This slowly removes inactive chunks over time. Any chunk with player structures will not be removed. This helps to keep the map (and file size) smaller over time.
oarc-mod-enable-world-eater=Enables world eater. This requires regrowth. This slowly checks all chunks for a lack of player structures and entities and marks them for removal. This helps to keep the map (and file size) smaller over time. This is more of an experimental feature, use at your own risk.
oarc-mod-enable-abandoned-base-cleanup=Abandoned bases will be cleaned up if players leave within a short time of joining. This does NOT require regrowth to be enabled.
oarc-mod-regrowth-cleanup-interval-min=This is the interval in minutes that the regrowth cleanup will run. Whenever a map cleanup happens, the game freezes for a second, so you don't want to run this too often! Abandoned base cleanup happens immediately when a player leaves and is not affected by this setting.
